# Sports GlyphMatrix Toys
Some toys to be used with the GlyphMatrix on the Nothing Phone 3. All still heavily beta, being worked on in my spare time.

This is the source code only, there is no final "app" yet. The repo must be cloned and opened in Android Studio, then built onto a Nothing Phone 3.

Bit of tidying up needed but the first three GlyphToys are working.

All these Toys use a custom 3x5 font to fit a bit more info onto the screen, allowing a bit more flexibility with things.
